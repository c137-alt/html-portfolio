<h3>Goodfellas</h3>
<p>My all time favorite movie. Great story telling and cinematography.</p> 

<h3>The Fast and the Furious</h3> 
<p>Nothing beats the original movie. Very nostaligic film for me based on one of my passions, fast cars.</p>

<h3>Dumb and Dumber</h3> 
<p>Probably the comedy film I most watched groiwng up. It always gives me a feel-good vibe when watching it and laughing the whole time.</p>
